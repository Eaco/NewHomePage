						<h1 class="center">Table Top Helper</h1>
						<p class="projectText">
							Tabletop Helper is a solution grown from a need in my own life, namely my unrelenting forgetfulness. Whenever I joined a table top RPG group, I would
							always - <b>always</b> forget my character sheets (information about the character you play) and thus, quickly become the least liked person in the whole group.
							This got me thinking though, we had the most complicated way of keeping track of the information we needed to play this game. The character sheets were physical,
							the game rules were digital, we kept backups on the cloud that were <b>constantly</b> out of date. On top of all this, it was all organized by the GM (Game master)
							texting each and every one of us separately and figuring out what nights worked for us all.
							<br/>
							It was an absolute mess.
							<br/>
							<br/>
							So I decided to take matters into my own hands and create a tool to help table top RPG players keep track of what they needed to play.
							It started out as nothing but a chat application, but has grown quickly into so much more. Now a party can keep their characters in a completely
							customisable character sheet page, connect with eachother via the chat window, and remember their favorite moments with the message board. With more tools on the
							way, it's quickly becoming everything an RPG party needs.
							<br/>
							<br/>
							Now for the tech specs - TTH is a single page application, built with Angular.js frontend logic, Bootstrap elements for the views, all on a node.js backend running
							off of a MongoDB Database. All communication between front and backend is achieved using WebSockets - Namely the Socket.io library, which allows for a responsive
							experience both when communicating with the server, and with other players.
							<br/>
							<br/>
							If you want to know more about the application, you can check it out on my GitHub, or see it in action at <a href="http://tabletophelper-bengineering.rhcloud.com">tabletophelper-bengineering.rhcloud.com</a>

						<h1 class="center">Chat Application</h1>
						<p class="projectText">
							This application was a long time in the making for me. Originally a simple (bad) application built using PHP on a pure Javascript frontend.
							<br/>
							Ajax polling going directly to a SQL query is an awful idea.
							<br/><br/>
							But I bettered myself, and started over from scratch once I was a bit less naive. Now the application is completely revamped to run on a Node.js backend,
							with WebSockets (Socket.io) replacing the sinful use of Ajax polling. The version that's live online is running on a MySQL database, but the TableTop Helper project
							(one page back) includes the same chat code running on a MongoDB database, if that's what you'd like to see.
							<br/><br/>
							Apart from that, there's not much to tell! Feel free to leave a message for me at <a href="http://nodesocketapp-bengineering.rhcloud.com/">nodesocketapp-bengineering.rhcloud.com/</a> It gets lonely over here.

						<p class="projectText">
							During my second year of high school, me and 7 other classmates founded a "Youth company" with the goal of designing, producing, and selling earphone holders.
							By the end of the school year we had sold not only to individual customers, but also sold in bulk to third party retailers.
							<br/><br/>
							With running a company comes a lot of responsibilities, hard work, and touch decisions, but in the end it was an excellent learning experience for both me and my classmates. We quickly learned to
							use each others strengths, and assist each other with our weaknesses when necessary. There aren't many experiences like running a company, and having done it in the past, I know it's something
							I'd like to eventually do again.
							<br/><br/>
							If anyone reading this would like a Lur-i-Box, let me know, I'm sure I still have the CAD designs lying around somewhere...

							Building random things has been an important part of my life. And by that I mean a whole lot of fun. Over my high school career I went from simple circuits on a breadboard
							to using my Arduino knowledge to help create an instrument playing machine we called the Automated Orchestra.
							<br/><br/>
							The automated orchestra was a side project done in our final year of high school made by myself, Jonathan Sjolund, and Patric Hardig, at Goranssonska high school. We used
							an Arduino, an industrial PLC controller, a touchscreen, and a whole mess of pneumatics to make one of the absolute most annoying creations I've ever come across, and I am
							so very proud to have been part of it.
							<br/><br/>
							The machine was capable of playing a Xylophone, Synthesizer, and Drum all at once, and could be pre-programmed to play songs, or could be played on the fly by using the
							touchscreen. As you can imagine, it was quite loud.
							<br/><br/>
							At some point along the way we even found a Joy Stick and decided to connect it - because we could. Sadly, the machine is still in Sweden, but I'll always have the videos to
							remind me of the monstrosity I once created.
